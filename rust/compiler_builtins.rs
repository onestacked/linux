//! Rust provides [`compiler_builtins`] as a port of LLVM's [`compiler-rt`].
//! Since we do not need the vast majority of them, we avoid the dependency
//! by providing this file.
//!
//! At the moment, some builtins are required that should not be. For instance,
//! [`core`] has 128-bit integers functionality which we should not be compiling
//! in. We will work with upstream [`core`] to provide feature flags to disable
//! the parts we do not need. For the moment, we define them to [`panic!`] at
//! runtime for simplicity to catch mistakes, instead of performing surgery
//! on `core.o`.
//!
//! In any case, all these symbols are weakened to ensure we do not override
//! those that may be provided by the rest of the kernel.
